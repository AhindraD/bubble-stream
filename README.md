# Bubble Stream - Claim Your Time!
## https://bubble-stream.onrender.com
### A streaming app, where you must claim time to get the stream running.
keep claiming time, or else the stream ends!
- starts with 51 secs
- stream ends when the progress bar reaches 0
- you can store up to 100 seconds
- Streamers and viewers must keep claiming time individually to stay alive. (it's a FEATURE, not a syncing bug, I Swear!!!)
- A more polished version with features is coming soon...
