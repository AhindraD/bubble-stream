### A streaming app, where you must claim time to get the stream running!
keep claiming time, or else the stream ends!
-1 starts with 50 secs
-2 stream ends when the progress bar reaches 0
-3 you can store up to 100 seconds
-4 Streamers and viewers must keep claiming time individually to stay alive. (it's a FEATURE, not a syncing bug, I Swear!!!)
-5 A more polished version with features is coming soon...
